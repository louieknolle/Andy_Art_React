        Born on the wrong side of the tracks, Andy Knolle began his art career with the blood of a roadkill deer.  With no brushes nearby, he struck a match on an old broomstick and painted with the smoldering broom straw.  His primary motivations in life are anarchy, subverting your perception of reality and the Chicago Black Sox.  He's not adverse to shedding a tear when moved by the beauty of his own work.  He's the shit and everyone should know it.

        His primary media are old ass camera film, block screen prints and the tortured love letters of his youth.  He can be found in Cincinnati either working in studios, photography gigs, or doing ollies at the skate park.  If you see something you like, please don't hesitate to give him a ring.  The only thing he loves more than developing film in his bathroom, is making sincere connections with fans of his work and genuinely dope individuals.
